## 📖 Project Overview

Routine Runner solves the **"cold start" problem** of daily habits. Instead of managing complex databases or navigating through multiple apps, it accepts a human-readable text block and converts it into a live, state-managed workflow that syncs seamlessly across all your devices.

### 🎯 Why Routine Runner?

- **Zero Friction**: No complex setup, no database migrations, just type your routine and go
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Start on your phone, continue on your laptop with real-time synchronization
- **Privacy First**: Your data stays in your Firebase instance - we never see your routines
- **Offline Capable**: Works even without internet connection using service worker caching
- **Focus Mode**: Minimal, glassmorphism UI designed for deep work sessions with wake lock support
- **Single File**: Entire app in one HTML file - easy to deploy, modify, and understand

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 **Smart Routine Parsing**

- **Bracket Syntax**: Clean, consistent syntax for times and durations (e.g., `[@06:00]`, `[20m]`).
- **Prayer Times**: Integrate Islamic prayer times into your routine with `[@Prayer:Fajr]` syntax.
- **Conditional Logic**: Show tasks only on specific days (e.g., `IF:MON::Task`).
- **Link Support**: Embed clickable links directly in tasks (e.g., `[https://...]`).
- **Priority Highlighting**: Mark important tasks with `==Text==` for a golden glow.

### 🎨 **Premium UI/UX**

- **Glassmorphism Design**: Modern, translucent card aesthetics with blurred backgrounds.
- **Adaptive Themes**: Rich Dark Mode and Frosty Light Mode.
- **Smooth Animations**: Fluid transitions for a polished feel.
- **Smart Controls**: Pause/Resume timers, Skip, Undo, and Auto-Advance.

### 🔄 **Real-Time Synchronization**

- **Instant Sync**: Changes appear immediately across all connected devices via Firestore.
- **Offline Support**: Continue working without internet; syncs when reconnected.
- **Cloud Backup**: Your routines and history are safely stored in Firestore.

### 📱 **Mobile-First Design**

- **PWA Ready**: Install on Android/iOS for native app experience.
- **Touch Controls**: Large buttons and gestures for mobile use.
- **Wake Lock**: Keeps screen active during timed tasks (configurable in Settings).

## 📝 Routine Syntax Guide

The app uses a powerful bracket-based syntax. Write your routine as a plain text list.

### 🎯 **Core Syntax Patterns**

| Syntax            | Type                 | Behavior             | Example                                 |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `[@HH:MM]`        | **Start At** (Gate)  | Blocks until time    | `Wake up [@06:00]`                      |
| `[=>HH:MM]`       | **End By** (Till)    | Count down to time   | `Work [=>17:00]`                        |
| `[Xm]`            | **Duration** (Timer) | Timer for X mins     | `Read [30m]`                            |
| `[@Prayer:Name]`  | **Prayer Gate**      | Blocks until prayer  | `Breakfast [@Prayer:Fajr]`              |
| `[=>Prayer:Name]` | **Prayer Till**      | Count down to prayer | `Morning Work [=>Prayer:Dhuhr]`         |
| `==Text==`        | **Priority**         | Golden border        | `==Workout== [30m]`                     |
| `IF:DAY::`        | **Condition**        | Only show on Day     | `IF:SUN::Relax`                         |
| `\| ELSE::`       | **Else**             | Fallback task        | `... \| ELSE::Work`                     |
| `[http...]`       | **Link**             | "Open Link" button   | `Meeting [https://meet.google.com/abc]` |

### 📋 **Complete Routine Example**

```text
🌅 Morning Routine [@Prayer:Fajr]
IF:MON::Start Week Review [15m]
IF:!SUN::==🏋️ Quick Workout== [20m]
🚿 Shower [15m]
🍳 Breakfast [30m]
🕌 Dhuhr Prayer [@Prayer:Dhuhr]
💼 Deep Work Session [=>Prayer:Asr]
🍽️ Lunch [=>13:00]
IF:FRI::🎉 Team Social [=>17:00] | ELSE::💼 Deep Work Session 2 [90m]
```

### 💡 **Tips**

- **Days for Conditions**: `MON`, `TUE`, `WED`, `THU`, `FRI`, `SAT`, `SUN`.
- **Negation**: Use `!` (e.g., `!SUN` means "Not Sunday").
- **Emojis**: The first emoji in a line becomes the task icon.

### 🔀 **Sub-Routines (Nested Tasks)**

Group related tasks under a parent using colon and dash syntax:

```text
JOURNAL:
- ❤️ Gratitude
- 🎯 Goals
- 📖 Reflection

📚 Study [30m]
```

The parent title appears at the bottom of the card as `JOURNAL [1/3]` while each sub-task is shown individually.

## 🕌 Prayer Times

Routine Runner integrates with the [Al Adhan API](https://aladhan.com) to fetch accurate prayer times for your location.

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings** → **Prayer Times**
2. Enter your **Latitude** and **Longitude** manually, OR
3. Click the **📍 GPS button** to auto-detect your location
4. Click **Save Location**

### Prayer Syntax

Use prayer times as gates (wait until) or tills (countdown to):

| Syntax             | Behavior             | Example                         |
| :----------------- | :------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `[@Prayer:Fajr]`   | Wait until Fajr time | `Wake up [@Prayer:Fajr]`        |
| `[=>Prayer:Dhuhr]` | Count down to Dhuhr  | `Morning Work [=>Prayer:Dhuhr]` |

### Valid Prayer Names

> **Note**: Use these exact names (case-insensitive): `Fajr`, `Dhuhr`, `Asr`, `Maghrib`, `Isha`

The app will warn you if you use an invalid prayer name when saving your routine.

### Example Prayer-Based Routine

```text
🌅 Wake Up [@Prayer:Fajr]
🧎 Fajr Prayer [15m]
📚 Morning Study [=>Prayer:Dhuhr]
🕌 Dhuhr Prayer [15m]
💼 Afternoon Work [=>Prayer:Asr]
🧎 Asr Prayer [15m]
🏃 Exercise [45m]
🕌 Maghrib Prayer [@Prayer:Maghrib]
🍽️ Dinner [30m]
📖 Evening Reading [=>Prayer:Isha]
🧎 Isha Prayer [15m]
🌙 Wind Down [30m]
```

## 📂 Multiple Routines

Manage multiple named routines with automatic or manual selection.

### Creating Routines

1. Go to **Settings** → **Manage Routines**
2. Click **Add New Routine**
3. Give it a name and add tasks
4. Set when it should run:
   - **Always (Default)**: Runs when no other routine matches
   - **Specific Days**: Mon, Wed, Fri, etc.
   - **Specific Dates**: 1st, 15th of each month
   - **Pattern**: First Friday, Last Monday, etc.
   - **Manual Only**: Only when you explicitly select it

### Auto-Selection

On app load, the routine is automatically selected based on:

1. Check each routine's conditions against today's date
2. First matching routine is activated
3. Falls back to the default routine if no match

### Quick Switch

- Tap the play icon (▶) next to any routine to switch immediately
- Current routine shown in Settings under "Active Routine"

---

## 📱 PWA Installation

- **Android**: Open Chrome -> Menu -> "Add to Home Screen".
- **iOS**: Open Safari -> Share -> "Add to Home Screen".
- **Desktop**: Click the Install icon in Chrome/Edge address bar.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS via CDN.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore).
- **Storage**: LocalStorage for settings, Firestore for data.
- **Logic**: Custom regex-based text parser with conditional evaluation.

### **Data Structure**

```javascript
// App State (synced to Firestore)
{
  routines: [
    {
      id: "routine-uuid",
      name: "Daily Routine",
      content: "📚 Study\n🪥 Brush",
      isDefault: true,
      conditions: { type: "weekday", weekdays: [1, 3, 5] } // or null
    }
  ],
  activeRoutineId: "routine-uuid",
  currentTaskIndex: 0,
  currentSubRoutineIndex: 0,
  history: { "2024-01-15": [...] }
}

// Parsed Task Object
{
  id: 0,
  text: "Morning Routine",
  icon: "🌅",
  type: "gate",           // gate | timer | till | standard
  meta: "06:00",          // Time or duration
  isHigh: false,          // Priority flag
  link: "https://...",    // Optional URL
  isSubRoutineParent: false,
  subRoutines: []         // Nested tasks for sub-routines
}
```
