# ToDo

## Urgent

- [ ] Multiple Routines
- [ ] Sub-Routines. For example: Journaling; first finance tracker, then habit tracker, then gym tracker and finally journallig. When we reach sub routines we will give one more done button and a number like 1/5, 2/5 until 5/5 when clicked the last done button of the sub routine we will go back to our normal routine. The symbols for this can be `:` and `-` as shown below:
